A few things jump out. Most of this looks solid, but I’d fix/flag these:

### 1) **“At this point in time…” item (Concision / Wordiness)**

* **Prompt:** “At this point in time, we do not have further comments.”
* **You marked correct:** **C** (“Currently, we do not have further comments.”)

**Issue:** On SAT/ACT-style concision questions, the cleanest is usually **“We do not have further comments.”** That option isn’t offered. Among your choices, **C** is fine, but **B (“At this time…”)** is also standard and arguably more “test-neutral” than *currently* (which can sometimes sound slightly casual/temporary). If you want a single best answer, consider revising choices to include:

* **E:** “We have no further comments.” (or “We have no additional comments.”)

### 2) **Introductory clause comma rule is overstated**

* **Prompt:** “While the analyst compiled the data she noticed a trend.”
* **You marked correct:** **C** (missing comma)

**Nuance:** A comma after an introductory dependent clause is a strong convention, but not always framed as an absolute “must” in all style guides. For standardized-test purposes, your key is probably fine. If you want it airtight, tweak the explanation to:

* “Standard test convention prefers a comma after an introductory dependent clause.”

### 3) **Singular “they” question (pronoun agreement)**

* **Prompt:** “If a person wants to succeed, they have to work hard.”
* **You marked correct:** **C** (“he or she”)

**Potential mismatch with modern SAT/ACT:** Modern test/editing conventions increasingly accept singular **they** when gender is unknown. Your explanation already notes that, but the **answer key may be contentious** depending on what “ruleset” you’re modeling. If you’re aiming for contemporary usage, you may want **A (NO CHANGE)** as correct, or rewrite the item to avoid the politics of it:

* Change antecedent to plural: “If people want to succeed, they have to work hard.” (then fix “you” in your D)

### 4) **“Site of the new building” item is awkward as written**

* **Prompt:** “The site of the new building is impressive.”
* You set **correct_answer: "D"** (“depends on context”)

That’s logically fine, but the sentence itself *sounds* like it wants **“sight”** (the appearance), not “site” (location). Without context, students may feel tricked. Two easy fixes:

* Add a context clue: “From the highway, the ___ of the new building is impressive.” → **sight**
* Or make “site” clearly about location: “The site for the new building is impressive.” / “The building site is impressive.”

### 5) **A couple of “best_choice” items are opinion-y**

Not wrong, but they may frustrate test-takers because multiple options can be defensible:

* **“This step is crucial.” placement**: B is reasonable, but A can also work rhetorically depending on intent (preview vs commentary).
* **“Split infinitives”**: broadly fine, but SAT/ACT-specific claims can be slippery. If this is meant to be test-realistic, you might reframe to: “In most modern standardized-test editing sections, split infinitives are not automatically treated as errors…”

### 6) Tiny consistency/style checks

* You mix labels: **“Fragments”** vs **“Sentence Fragments”** as subtopics (same concept, two names).
* Tag consistency: e.g., sometimes **"concision"** sometimes **"wordiness"**; fine, but if you plan analytics, consider a controlled vocabulary.

If you want, I can propose revised versions for the ~4 “high-risk ambiguity” cards (pronoun they, site/sight, “This step is crucial,” and “At this point in time”) while keeping your schema unchanged.
