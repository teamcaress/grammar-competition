# ACT Prep -> Carding Guide

Source: `resources/act-prep.md` (ACT English sections + explanatory answers).

## What To Use From This Source

Use these parts as primary ACT signals:

- "Content of the ACT English Test"
- "Types of Questions on the ACT English Test"
- "Conventions of Standard English / Production of Writing / Knowledge of Language"
- English explanatory answer sections (Practice Tests 1-6)

## ACT-Style Question Archetypes To Mirror

- Underlined-portion replacement with `NO CHANGE` as one choice.
- "Best answer is NOT acceptable" logic (3 valid, 1 invalid).
- Add/Delete sentence relevance questions.
- Sentence placement/order questions (where to place sentence).
- Transition-fit questions (logical relation between sentences).
- Tone/style consistency questions.

## High-Value Error Families (Observed Repeatedly)

- Sentence fragments and run-ons from faulty clause joining.
- Pronoun clarity and pronoun-antecedent agreement.
- Transition logic mismatches.
- Parallel structure breaks in coordinated phrases.
- Misplaced/dangling modifiers.
- Punctuation misuse:
  - unnecessary commas
  - semicolon misuse
  - colon misuse
  - apostrophe/possessive confusion (`its` vs `it's`)
- Wordiness/redundancy and precision failures.

## Distractor Construction Rules (ACT-Consistent)

- Build distractors that look plausible but fail for one clear reason.
- Keep most answer choices close in length and syntax.
- Prefer "single-fault" distractors over absurd wrong answers.
- For punctuation questions:
  - keep wording identical across choices when possible
  - vary only punctuation to isolate the tested skill
- For transition questions:
  - include at least two semantically plausible but logically wrong connectors.
- For relevance/organization questions:
  - wrong choices should be topical but misaligned to the paragraph goal.

## Answer/Explanation Style

- Explanation starts with the rule being tested.
- Then name why each wrong pattern fails (fragment, ambiguity, redundancy, etc.).
- Keep explanation concise (1-3 sentences).

## Metadata Conventions

Use these fields on every card:

- `exam_targets`: include `ACT` (and `SAT` if shared skill)
- `source_section`: one of:
  - `ACT English: Conventions of Standard English`
  - `ACT English: Production of Writing`
  - `ACT English: Knowledge of Language`
  - `ACT English Explanatory Answers`
- `skill_code`: snake_case and specific to the micro-skill
